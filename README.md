A small demo project to learn Rust by implementing an Eulerian fluid simulation.
This project has been inspired by
[TenMinutesPhysics](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/tenMinutePhysics/index.html).
The basics are easy to understand, but as always "the dog is buried in the
details" as we phrase it in German. Its probably a fact in the field of
scientific simulation that most boilerplate code is there to deal with the
beautiful (ðŸ˜¨) boundaries of your simulation domain, data structures etc.

The simulation is implemented with the same procedure as as in
[fluid.sim](https://github.com/matthias-research/pages/blob/master/tenMinutePhysics/17-fluidSim.html)
with some additional dat`a structures to support the computation.

# Introduction

The CLI simulator is in [src/main.rs](src/main.rs) which sets up the scene with
a [grid](src/solver/grid.rs) and hands it over to the
[timestepper](src/solver/timestepper.rs) which is responsible to integrate the
grid. Disclaimer: This design is not yet perfect but it was more to play around
with the different concepts in Rust.

You can start the simulation with

```shell
cargo run --release --bin rustofluid -- -e 10.0 -t "$timestep" --incompress-iters 100 --dim "400,200"
```

To install `cargo` use
[this help here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

To create the video with `30` frames use:

```shell
./create-video.sh 30
```

# Parallel Implementation

To implement the parallel version of
[`solve_incompressibility`](src/scene/grid.rs#L330) I needed to split
`grid.cells` successively into parts with an iterator chain until ending up with
an iterator which produces stencils in the form
[`PosStencilMut<Cell>`](src/scene/grid_stencil.rs#L44). This iterator can be
converted to a parallel iterator by replacing the iterator chain with the
parallel functions from `rayon`.

The following picture illustrates the topology:

The parallel version with `./create-video.sh 30 --parallel` is currently much
slower than the serial one. The parallelization is probably to fine grained to
be efficient and the `Cell` driven layout is probably not that good for cache
friendliness.
